# bovana
Database course project at the University of Padua (Academic year 2014)

With this project I tried to replicate a management of bovine animals.
The DB (made with PostgreSQL) is contained in .sql files. I drawed the entityâ€“relationship model (ER model) with [JDER](http://www.ballini.it/Software/ProgER/) in directory ER.
The PHP directory contains the user interface to manage the DB, like:
* add farmers
* add bovine animals
* add medicines
* assign a bovine animals to farmer
* assign a medicine to bovine animal
